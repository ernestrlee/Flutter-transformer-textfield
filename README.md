# Flutter-transformer-textfield

The transformer textfield allows you to display text that is "transformed" after the textfield loses focus.
In this example, the transform function converts all characters to uppercase after the textfield loses focus.<br/>

Although you may be able to accomplish this using a text editing controller, another use of this concept is to adapt it to transform text into widgets, such as rich text, by applying the desired transform function.
